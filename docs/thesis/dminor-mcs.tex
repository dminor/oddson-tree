\section{Problem Statement}

We investigate the utility of data structures for biased nearest neighbour
search in practice. The nearest neighbour search problem is to return the
closest point in a set of points to a specified query point. In the biased
version of this problem, information on the relative frequence of queries
is available, allowing for more common queries to be answered more quickly.

Nearest neighbour search is of considerable practical interest with
applications in geographical information systems, computer graphics,
computer vision, signal processing and machine learning, and has received
considerable attention from both theoretical and applied computer scienets
since the early 1970s.

Although theoretically optimal solutions have existed since the 1990s, these
suffer from the so-called "curse of dimensionality" where as the number of
dimensions increases, an increasingly large number of points must be searched
until performance in practice is no better than a brute force search of all of
the points. Even in low dimensions, nearest neighbour search can be a difficult
problem in practice given a large enough point set or the requirement to support
a large number of queries in a timely fashion. For these reasons, research has
continued to investigate heuristic and approximate approaches to nearest
neighbour search. 
 
Recently, two groups of researchers \cite{chan} \cite{oddson} have proposed a
a biased data structure, called odds-on trees in \cite{oddson},  which can be
applied to a variety of geometrical search problems and which seems as though it
may be of practical as well as theoretical interest.

In a sense, the odds-on tree data structure provides a theoretical basis for
the creation of heuristics to accelerate geometrical search problems. Since
nearest neighbour search is a problem of practical interest with a number of
existing heuristic solutions with varying degrees of justification in theory,
it seemed a natural area to which to apply the odds-on tree with a view to
determining its effectiveness in practice.

Our goal is to implement a practical data structure based on the theoretical
results about odds-on trees.  This involves design and implementation work as
well as extensive experimentation to establish correctness and performance
characteristics. Since the performance of odds-on trees is dependent upon the
probability distribution of the queries, it is necessary to do experimentation
based upon a wide variety of query distributions, including some derived from
applications of nearest neighbour search.

\section{Definitions}

Following terminology associated with Voronoi diagrams, we define the set of
points for which nearest neighbour searches will be performed as sites. Each
site defines an area, called a cell, which for all points inside the cell, the
associated site is the nearest neigbhour for a given metric.

A nearest neighbour search is given a point \(p\) determine which site is
closest to it for a given metric. A \(k\)-nearest neighbour search is given a
point \(p\) and an integer \(k\) return the \(k\) sites which are closest to it. 

A \(1 + \epsilon\) approximate nearest neighbour search is given a point \(p\),
return a site which is no more than \(1 + \epsilon\) times further away than
the true nearest neigbhour.

A \(1 + \epsilon\) approximate \(k\)-nearest neighbour search is given a point
\(p\), return \(k\) points such than none are further away than \(1 + \epsilon\)
times the true \(k\)th nearest neighbour.

\section{Organization of the Thesis}

The remainder of the thesis is organized as follows: Chapter 2 summarizes
previous work for biased search, distribution sensitive data structures and
nearest neighbour search.  Chapter 3 describes the design and implementation of
the odds-on tree, including an description of alternative designs which were
explored.  Chapter 4 gives details on the experimentation performed and results
obtained, and Chapter 5 summarizes the results and discusses potential 
future work.

\chapter{Previous Work}

In this section we examine previous work relevant to odds-on tree. In the first
section we examine data structures for nearest-neighbour search. In the second
section we present results on biased search in one dimension and describe
the odds-on tree data structure.

\section{Nearest Neighbour Search}

In this section we examine data structures and algorithms for nearest-neighbour
search. We restrict ourselves to algorithms which operate in a comparison tree
model, where data structures make decisions based upon making comparisons
between point coordinates.

By operating in a comparison tree model, we also restrict ourselves to nearest
neighbour search in relatively small dimensions. The effective of comparison
based approaches diminishes as the dimensional increases. Evidence suggests in
cases with 16 dimensions or more, using comparison based approaches performs no
better than a brute force search of all of the points \cite{fastvector}.

Since they are not relevant for the remainder of this thesis, we do not consider
approaches based upon hashing, such as locality sensitive hashing \cite{lsh}
or metric trees, where points are sorted based upon distance to a reference
point rather than based upon their coordinates. Chapter 4 of the book by Samet
\cite{samet} features a comprehensive treatment of nearest neighbour search in
higher dimensions. The paper by Liu et al. evaluates some of these techniques
experimentally \cite{practicalann}. 

We also restrict ourselves to an in-memory model, and so do not consider
external memory based data structures such as R-trees \cite{rtree}. Since an
odds-on tree is essentially a cache, it is less interesting to consider an
external memory representation, although an odds-on tree may be quite useful
as an in-memory cache for an external memory data structure.

\subsection{Voronoi Diagrams}

One way of looking at nearest neighbour search is as a subdivision of the plane
into disjoint areas based upon which site to which they are closest. Finding
the nearest neighbour to a query point is then a matter of determining which
subdivision the query point lies in.

A traditional name for this problem is the post-office problem, where given a
set of sites (the post-offices) determine for a given query point which
post-office is closest \cite{dutch}.

The Voronoi diagram for a set of sites is the subdivison of the plane (or
hyper-plane) into cells, where for every point in a cell, its nearest neighbour
is the site associated with the cell. Efficient algorithms exist for creating
Voronoi diagrams in low dimensions:

\begin{thm} \emph{(Voronoi Diagram Construction)}
The Voronoi diagram for a set of n points in two dimensions can be computed
in time \(O(n \log n)\). In higher dimensions, the time becomes
\(O(n \log n + n^(\lceil(d/2)\rceil))\) where d is the dimensionality of the
space \cite{dutch}.
\end{thm}

TODO: insert voronoi diagram

\subsubsection{Nearest Neighbour Search in a Voronoi Diagram}

Once the Voronoi diagram is constructed, determining the nearest neighbour can
be done by performing point location to determine in which Voronoi cell the
query point lies.

In 2D, an efficient data structure for the more general problem of point
location in a planar subdivision was described by Kirkpatrick
\cite{kirkpatrick}. It based upon first triangulating the subdivision and then
removing independent vertices (those which do not share an edge) from the
triangulation to create a triangulation with fewer faces. Provided a constant
number of vertices are removed from the triangulation at each step, performing
the triangulation recursively will result in a data structure which supports
point location in logarithmic time.

\begin{thm} \emph{(Point Location in the Plane)}
A data structure exists using \(O(n)\) storage which allows for planar
point location to be performed in \(O(\log n)\) time \cite{kirkpatrick}.
\end{thm}

In higher dimensions, given n hyperplanes, it is possible to solve this problem
by constructing a \(1/r\)-cutting, which is a collection of simplices which
covers the space and is constructed such that each simplice intersects with no
more than \(n/r\) hyperplanes. Chazelle gives a hierarchical construction
procedure for these hyperplanes such that a simplice is eventually fully
contained in one of the cells, which can then be labelled and used to perform
point location \cite{chazelle}.

\begin{thm} \emph{(Point Location in Higher Dimensions)}
A data structure exists using \(O(n^d)\) storage which allows for  
point location in a d-dimensional arrangment of hyperplanes to be performed in
\(O(\log n)\) time \cite{chazelle}.
\end{thm}

Nearest-neigbhour search can be performed using Voronoi diagrams and provides
efficient algorithms in the plane. To extend this to reporting k-nearest
neighbours, once the Voronoi cell containting the query point has been
identified, the neighbour cells of the Voronoi diagram can be examined until
a sufficient number of neighbours has been found. 

In higher dimensions, the time requirement to build a Voronoi diagram and the
space requirement for the point location data structure both depend upon the
dimension of the space in an exponential fasion, which limits both their
theoretical and practical utility for this problem.

\subsection{Quadtrees}

Quadtrees are based upon recursively dividing n-dimensional space into \(2^n\)
equal sized hypercubes, with each node in the tree keeping pointers to its
children.  In the two dimensional case, this means that space is divided into
four quadrants, hence the name quadtrees. Quadtrees were introduced in 1974 by
Finkel and Bentley \cite{quadtree}. 

Quadtrees can be built over a region, in which case the subdivision proceeds
until the portion of the region covered by a hypercube has the same value for
some property of interest. For example, given an input image, a region based
quadtree would continue to subdivide until each square covered an area which
had the same colour. Quadtrees over a region are called Trie-based quadtrees in
\cite{samet} and can be used to approximate Voronoi diagrams, as discussed
below.

In this section we use quadtrees that are defined over a set of points, in which
case the recursive subdivision is done until each hypercube contains a single
point from the point set.

The root of the quadtree is the hypercube containing all of the points, a leaf
is a hypercube containing a single point, and the height of a quadtree
is the longest path from the root of the quadtree to the leaf of a quadtree
\cite{dutch}.

\begin{thm} \emph{(Height of a Quadtree)}
The height of a quadtree for a set of n points has an upper bound of \(\log(s/c)
+ 3/2\), where c is the smallest distance between any two points in the set, and
s is the side length of the initial square containing all of the points.
\cite{dutch}.
\end{thm}

Note that the height of the quadtree is not bounded by n.

\begin{thm} \emph{(Quadtree Construction)}
A quadtree of height h containing n points can be constructed in \(O((h + 1)n)\)
time \cite{dutch}.
\end{thm}

\subsubsection{Point Location in a Quadtree}

Point location in a quadtree is performed by recursively visiting nodes
starting with the root node. At each step, the child node containing the query
point is visited, and the algorithm terminates when a leaf node is reached.

\begin{thm} \emph{(Point Location in a Quadtree)} 
Point location in a quadtree of height h can be performed in time \(O(h)\). 
\end{thm}

\subsubsection{Nearest Neighbour Search in a Quadtree}

Given a query point p the quadtree node containing p, if any, can be found by
starting at the root, comparing p to the bounds of the each child of the root,
and recursively visiting the child containing p until a leaf node is found.  
Since the maximum depth of a quadtree with n points is not bounded by n, the
running time of this search algorithm is also not bounded by n. This search,
along with a means of performing region queries was described in
\cite{quadtree}.

To perform nearest neighbour search in a quadtree we adapt the procedure given
in \cite{samet} for kd-trees. Finding a nearest neighbour in a quadtree is done
by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to visit, which initially contains the
root node. The algorithm proceeds by removing a node from the priority queue and
examining each of its children. If the child node contains a point it is added
to the result set.

Otherwise, the distance from the query point to each child node is calculated
and if it is smaller than the distance to the current furthest result point,
it is added to the priority queue. The work done by this algorithm is at
least the same amount of work required to do perform a point location query.

\begin{thm} \emph{(Nearest Neighbour Search in a Quadtree)} 
Nearest neighbour search in a quadtree of height h requires \(O(h)\) time.
\end{thm}

TODO: quadtree diagram

\subsection{Compressed Quadtrees}

In a compressed quadtree, only nodes which contain a point, or have at least
two child nodes are present in the tree. Compressed quadtrees were first
described in \cite{compressedquadtree}, and a detailed description can be found
in \cite{skipquadtree}.

A compressed quadtree can be created by pruning nodes from an existing quadtree
as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If a node contains no children, remove it.
\item If a node has a single child node, change the pointer to the node in the
node's parent to point to the node's child.
\end{enumerate}

Since this procedure requires first building a regular quadtree, it also
requires \(O((h + 1)n\) time to complete.

This construction procedure can be made more efficient, or at least bounded by
n, by first sorting the points according to Morton (or z-) order. Morton order
is defined by interleaving the bits of each of coordinate of the point, such
that the first bit of the first coordinate is followed by the first bit of the
second coordinate and so on until one bit has been used from each coordinate.
This is then followed by the second bit of the first coordinate \cite{morton}.
When performed in two dimensions, this results in a z-shaped curve. This
interleaving of bits is called the "shuffle" of a point in \cite{bern}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{diagrams/zorder.eps}
\caption{Z-Order}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The points are then sorting according their Morton order. Each two adjacent
points in the sorted order form a node in the quadtree, which can then be
nested by finding the first larger square to the left and the right in the
sorted order \cite{bern}.

\begin{thm} \emph{(Compressed Quadtree Construction)}
A quadtree containing n points can be constructed in \(O(n \log n)\) time
\cite{bern}.
\end{thm}

Chan \cite{chan} showed that the shuffle can be calculated without explicitly
interleaving the bits, and \cite{connor} showed that this can be extended from
integer values to IEEE-754 floating point values.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{diagrams/compressed_quadtree.eps}
\caption{Compressed Quadtree}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{thm} \emph{(Height of Compressed Quadtree)}
The height of a compressed quadtree with n points is O(n).
\end{thm}

\subsubsection{Point Location in a Compressed Quadtree}

Point location in a compressed quadtree is done by following the same algorithm
as for standard quadtrees. Since the height of a compressed quadtree is
bounded by the number of points, we can bound the time required to perform
point location.

\begin{thm} \emph{(Point Location in a Compressed Quadtree)} 
Point location in a compressed quadtree with n points can be performed in
time \(O(n)\). 
\end{thm}

\subsubsection{Nearest Neighbour Search in a Compressed Quadtree}

Nearest neighbour search in a compressed quadtree can be done by following the
same algorithm as for standard quadtrees. Again, since the height of a compressed
quadtree is bounded by the number of points, we can bound the time required to
perform point location.

\begin{thm} \emph{(Nearest Neighbour Search in a Compressed Quadtree)} 
Nearest neighbour search in a compressed quadtree with n points requires
\(O(n)\) time.
\end{thm}

\subsection{Skip Quadtrees}

Skip quadtrees extend the idea of skip lists \cite{skiplist} to 2D and higher
dimensional spaces. In a skip list, multiple levels of linked lists exist, with
pointers between the levels.  The bottom level contains all of the nodes, the
top layer is empty, and (in the randomized version of skip lists,) a node
present in a given layer is present in the layer above it with specified
probability.  Corresponding nodes on different levels are then linked. The
expected number of layers is logarithmic, allowing for search in \(O(\log n)\)
time.

Skip quadtrees use essentially the same idea, except each level is a
compressed quadtree rather than a linked list, and terminal nodes in the
compressed quadtree at one level are linked to corresponding nodes in the
lower level tree.  We summarize the results are for the randomized version of
skip quadtrees.  Deterministic results can also be derived using deterministic
skip lists \cite{skipquadtree}.

Since each level of a skip quadtree consists of a compressed quadtree with
approximately half as many points as that in the level below, we expect to
create \(O(\log n)\) compressed quadtrees.

\begin{thm} \emph{(Skip Quadtree Construction)}
A quadtree containing n points can be constructed in \(O(n \log^2 n)\)
expected time.
\end{thm}

\subsubsection{Point Location in a Skip Quadtree}

Point location in a skip quadtree is peformed by recursively visiting each level
of the quadtree. Since each level is a compressed quadtree, point location is
first performed in that compressed quadtree. Once the node in the compressed
quadtree is located, the link to the corresponding node in the lower level
is visited until the bottom level is reached and the node in that compressed
quadtree is returned as the result of the point location query. The expected
amount of work performed in each level is constant \cite{skipquadtree}.

\begin{thm} \emph{(Point Location in a Skip Quadtree)} 
Point location in a skip quadtree with n points can be performed in time
\(O(\log n\)) \cite{skipquadtree}. 
\end{thm}

\subsubsection{Nearest Neighbour Search in a Skip Quadtree}

Nearest neighbour search in a skip quadtree is similar to the procedure for
searching a standard quadtree, but the skip structure is used to limit
the number of nodes visited.

For a node p removed from the priority queue, the skip structure is used to
determine the node q, which is the smallest node in the lowest skip level
which is equidistant to the query point. It is shown in \cite{skipquadtree}
that at most \(O(\log 1 \over \epsilon)\) nodes on the path from p to q need
to be added to the priority queue.

\begin{thm} \emph{(Nearest Neighbour Search in a Quadtree)} 
Approximate \(1 + \epsilon\) nearest neighbour search for d dimensions in a skip
quadtree with n points requires
\(O(\epsilon^(1 - d)(\log n + \log \epsilon^(-1)))\) expected time.
\end{thm}

\subsection{Kd-Trees}

Kd-trees were described by Jon Bentley in 1975 as an improvement on quadtrees
\cite{kdtree}.  Kd-trees are binary search trees for which each non-leaf node
divides the point set in half using an axis-aligned line.

Kd-trees are constructed by choosing an axis, determining the median value in
the point set for the corresponding coordinate, and dividing the points in two
halves using the median value.  The two child nodes are then built by
recursively building kd-trees for each half.  Depending upon the application,
a number of heuristics exist for choosindg which axis to use for dividing the
points.

\begin{thm} \emph{(Height of a Kd-Tree)}
The height of a kd-tree with n points is \(O(\log n)\).
\end{thm}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{diagrams/kdtree.eps}
\caption{Kd-Tree}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Point Location in a Kd-Tree}

Point location in a kd-tree can be performed by recursively visiting nodes and
comparing the appropriate coordinate of the point to the splitting axis used
to split the children for that node, and the visiting the appropriate child
node \cite{kdtree}.

\begin{thm} \emph{(Point Location in a Kd-Tree)} 
Point location in a skip quadtree with n points can be performed in time
\(O(\log n\)). 
\end{thm}

\subsubsection{Nearest Neighbour Search in a Kd-tree}

An algorithm for nearest-neighbour search in a kd-tree tree was described
by Friedman et al. \cite{friedman} in 1977 as an improvement on the algorithm
contained in the original paper describing kd-trees.

The algorithm proceeds in a manner similar to the procedure for point-location,
but at each step the child node that was not visited is added to a priority
queue. When a leaf node is reached, the point at that node is added to the
result set and the priority queue is examined. If the closest node in the
priority queue is closer than the furthest point in the result set, then it
is visited according to the recursive procedure given for point location. 

For a \(1 + \epsilon\) approximate nearest neighbour search, nodes in the
priority queue are only visited if they closer than \(1 + \epsilon\) times
the distance to furthest point in the result set.

\begin{thm} \emph{(Nearest Neighbour Search in a Kd-tree)} 
The expected time for nearest-neighbour search in a kd-tree with n points is
\(O \log(n)\), and the worst case is \(O(n)\) \cite{friedman}.
\end{thm}

\subsection{Balanced Box Decomposition (BBD) Trees}

A balanced box decomposition tree is a data structure invented by Arya et al.
\cite{optimalann} which combines advantages of both quadtrees and kd-trees.
Like a kd-tree, as one traverses the tree, the number of points decreases
exponentially, and like a quadtree, the area also decreases exponentially. By
combinging these properties, an optimal data structure for approximate nearest
neighbour search is obtained.

Each node in a BBD-tree covers a cell which is the set theoretic difference
between an outer box and an optional inner box. Both boxes are axis-aligned.
If present, the inner box must either touch the edge of the outer box, or be
separated from each edge by at least the width of the box in the direction of
the edge. Each node is an BBD-tree has a bounded aspect ratio which ensures
that the ratio of the shortest edge to the longest edge is bounded by some
constant.

A BBD-tree is constructed through a sequence of two operations, fair-splits
and shrinks. A fair-split is a partition of a box using an axis aligned
hyperplane, which maintains the aspect ratio bound but does not necessarily
result in an even partition of points. A shrink operation divides a node into
inner and outer boxes, which is used in a manner similar to a compressed
quadtree, and can ensure an even partition of points \cite{optimalann}.

Both fair-splits and shrinks can be performed in time linear in the number of
points contained in the cell. A simple strategy for partitioning the points is
the midpoint algorithm, which performs a fair-split by partitioning the node
with a hyperplane orthogonal to the longest edge of the outer box. A shrink
operation is somewhat more complicated, potentially requiring two shrink nodes
and one split node to ensure that no child contains more than \(2/3\) of the
points covered by the parent node \cite{optimalann}.

To prove properties of the BBD-tree, Arya et al. assume that fair-splits and
shrinks are applied alternately as the tree is constructed. In practice, they
note that for almost all cases, only fair-splits are required \cite{optimalann}. 

\begin{thm} \emph{(BBD-Tree Construction)} 
A BBD-tree for a \(d\)-dimensional space has \(O(n)\) nodes and can be build in
\(O(d n \log n)\) time \cite{optimalann}.
\end{thm}

\subsubsection{Nearest Neighbour Search in a BBD Tree}

Nearest neighbour search in a BBD Tree is performed in a manner similar to
search in a kd-tree. A priority queue is maintained of nodes to visit which
initially contains the root node. At each step of the search, the closest
node to the point is removed from the queue and is recursively searched for
the leaf closest to the search point. The distance to the other child nodes
encountered in the search is calculated and they are enqueued in the priority
queue. The search continues until the distance to the node at the top of the
priority queue exceeds the distance to the candidate nearest neighbour. This
can be easily extended to find k nearest neighbours, and to find approximate
nearest neighbours rather than an exact ones.

\begin{thm} \emph{(Nearest Neighbour Search in a BBD Tree)} 
Given a constant \(c_{d,\epsilon} \le \lceil 1 + {6d \over \epsilon} \rceil^d\)
where d is the dimensionality of the space and \(\epsilon\) is the approximation
factor, a \((1 + \epsilon)\)-nearest neighbour search in a BBD Tree can be
performed in time \(O(c_{d,\epsilon} \log n)\) time and k approximate neareest
neigbhours can be found in \(O((c_{d,\epsilon} + kd) \log n)\) time.
\end{thm}

\subsection{Approximate Voronoi Diagrams}

For approximate nearest-neighbour searches, it is possible to improve on the
space requirements by creating an approximation to the Voronoi diagram, for
instance using quadtrees \cite{avd}. The complexity of the calculation is
reduced by constructing the Voronoi diagram such that for each cell, any point
within it is a \(1 + \epsilon\)-nearest neighbour, rather than an exact
nearest neigbhour.

Har-Peled \cite{avd} provides an algorithm for building an approximate
Voronoi diagram which returns a answers nearest-neighbour searches. His
construction is complicated, requiring first clustering the input sites, then
building a data structure for answerings point location in equal ball queries
(a technique also used in locality sensitive hashing \cite{lsh}) and finally
using this data structure to build the approximate Voronoi diagram using
compressed quadtrees.

Arya et al. \cite{arya-avd} extend this to \(t, \epsilon\)-AVD where each
cell in the approximate Voronoi diagram stores \(t\) approximate nearest
neighbours. Their construction makes use of a well-separated pair
decomposition of the sites of the Voronoi diagram. Two sets of points are well
separated if each set can be bounded by a ball of radius \(r\) such that the
distance between the center of each set is at least \(2r\). By decomposing
the sites into well-separated subsets, a set of quadtree nodes can be
generated which are then stored in a BBD-tree. 

We do not describe the construction algorithm in detail as these results are
not used in the remainder of the thesis. We note that both \(\epsilon\) and t
need to be fixed at construction time, which is a less flexible than using
quadtrees or kd-trees directly.

\begin{thm} \emph{(Nearest Neighbour Search in a Approximate Voronoi Diagram)} 
An approximate Voronoi diagram of size \(O({n \over \epsilon ^ d}\) can be
constructed which can answer \((1 + \epsilon)\) approximate nearest neighbour
searches in time \(O(log ({n \over \epsilon}))\) \cite{arya-avd}.
\end{thm}

\section{Biased Search}

In this section we examine biased search problem in a comparison tree model.
We begin with some classical results for biased search trees in a single
dimension, before considering the problem in higher dimensional spaces.

\subsection{Biased Search Trees}

Biased search trees are a natural generalization of balancing a binary search
tree where rather than assuming each result is equally likely, a probability
distribution is given for the results, allowing the tree to be balanced such
that at each node it is equally likely that the left or right child will be
followed.  The overall expected running time can then be stated in terms of the
entropy of the probability distribution of the queries.

\subsubsection{Static Biased Search Trees}

The initial work on biased search trees focused on the static case, where
the query frequencies are known in advance and no deletions and insertions
are allowed. This work is summarized in \cite{knuth}.

Given a set of n keys \(K_i\) and \(2n + 1\) probabilities
\(p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\) and \(q_1, q_2, ..., q_n\) where \(p_i\) is the
probability that \(K_i\) is the search item and \(q_i\) is the
probability that the search item lies between \(K_i\) and \(K_{i+1}\), an
optimal biased search tree is one that minimizes the expected number of
comparisons to search the tree \cite{knuth}.

Each subtree of a optimal biased search tree is itself optimal, and so the
problem can be solved through a dynamic programming algorithm.

TODO: more detail from knuth

\begin{thm} \emph{(Construction of a Static Biased Binary Search Tree)} 
An optimal static biased search tree can be constructed in time \(O(n^2)\).
\end{thm}

\subsubsection{Dynamic Biased Search Trees}

Biased search trees allowing insertions and deletions based upon 2 - 4 and
red-black trees were described by Bent, Sleator and Tarjan \cite{bst} in 1984.
The data structures are complex and do not appear to have been implemented.
Feigenbaum and Tarjan describe somewhat simpler data structures \cite{bst2}.

TODO: more details

\begin{thm} \emph{(Construction of a Dynamic Biased Binary Search Tree)} 
\end{thm}

Simpler implementations of biased search exist, based upon randomized search
trees (treaps) \cite{treap} and biased skip lists \cite{bsl2}.

TODO: re-read these papers to see if they provide any performance analysis

\subsubsection{Splaytrees}

An alternative approach to biased search is to use data structures which
modify themselves in response to queries.  In this case, rather than specifying
the probabilities in advance, the data structure will change itself to match
the query distribution.

Splaytrees \cite{splaytree}, which were invented by Sleator and Tarjan, are a
self-modifying binary search tree which have received considerable attention,
both theoretical and experimental due to the dynamic optimality conjecture,
which states that splaytrees are within a constant factor of optimal for any
sequence of queries, without needing to know the queries in advance.

TODO: more details on this...

\begin{thm} \emph{(TODO)} 
TODO: theorems on splaytrees
\end{thm}

\subsection{Distribution Sensitive Data Structures}

A distribution sensitive data structure makes use of knowledge of the
probability distribution of the queries in order to answer queries with an
expected runtime which is of the order of the entropy present in the query
distribution. This is a slightly different formulation of the problem than
biased search, where the running time is given in terms of the entropy of
the query results.

Another way of viewing the problem is to consider instance optimal data
structures \cite{chan}, where the running time is within a constant factor
of any data structure for any instance of the problem. TODO: more details,
mention how different viewpoint results in similar analysis.

TODO: Refer to at least Biased Range Trees paper, some results in distribution
sensitive point location.

\subsubsection{Odds-on Trees}

TODO: Description of partition tree based odds-on tree and theorems for
running time.

\chapter{Implementation}

This chapter describes the implementation of the odds-on tree data structure
for nearest-neighbour search.

The theoretical properties of odds-on trees were derived using partition trees.
Since partition trees are not practical to implement, we instead chose to use
compressed quadtrees and kd-trees. Kd-trees have better theoretical performance
than quadtrees, and typically perform better in practice as well, but we
decided to implement both to see if this holds true when used to implement
odds-on trees.

\section{Experiment Design}

The experimental hypothesis is that the odds-on tree provides better k-nn
performance than a kd-tree implementation in cases where the entropy of the
query set is sufficiently low.

This hypothesis is tested using both synthetic data drawn from probability
distributions, and with data derived from applications of nearest neighbour
search. 

\subsection{Synthetic Data}

\subsubsection{Implementation}

Since preliminary experimentation with the kd-tree and quadtree based
implementations did not show one to out perform the other consistently, each
experiment was repeated for both implementations.

\subsubsection{Dimension}

TODO:
- will definitely experiment in 2, 3, 4 dimensions.
- both kd-trees and quadtrees perform poorly in higher dimensions.  The "curse
of dimensionality" says the number of sample points required to build the cache
should grow quickly as dimension increases, but kd-tree performance also quickly
gets worse.
- will try 8, 16 dimensions in a limited number of cases to see if it is worth
while doing full studies, but literature says this will likely not work well.

\subsubsection{Point Set}

The point set

- distribution of points: uniform or mixture of gaussians
- number of points: 10000, 100000, 1000000 

To reduce variance, the point set which was queried to determine the nearest
neighbour was maintained between trials.  Two distributions were used for the

\subsubsection{Sample Set}

The sample set is the set of searches used to build the odds-on tree.

\subsubsection{Search Set}

The search set is the set of searches used to  test the odds-on tree and
kd-tree implementations.  In all cases, the search set is drawn from the same
distribution used to generate the sample set, and the number of searches was
fixed at 1000000. 

TODO: briefly describe distributions used to generate points: uniform, gaussian,
mixture of gaussians.

\subsection{Application Data}

Sites such as ColorLovers.com \cite{colorlovers} allow users to define a
colours as a triplet of RGB values, which are used in turn to define colour
themes, which are sets of 1 or more colours which work well together in a
design.

One may want to find the nearest named colour to a given RGB value for
a number of reasons, including buying a paint formulation which matches the
desired colour.  For instance, ColorLovers will provided the closest Martha
Stewart paint colour to a given colour if a user wishes to use a paint.

In the Pantone \cite{pantone} printing process, colours are chosen from a set of
approximately 1000 spot colours rather than using mixtures of four inks as is
done in the CMYK process.

Since some colours are more popular choices than others, in particular when
creating colour themes, this provides a biased search in three dimensions. We
use the colour theme datasets created by \cite{colorthemes}.

\section{Measuring Performance}

\subsection{Benchmark Platform}

An Intel Core I5 laptop was used as the benchmark platform.

\subsection{Performance Metrics}

The primary performance metric is running time.  For each experiment
configuration, 1000000 queries are performed and the elapsed system clock
time is recorded.

In addition to running time, data is collected on the cache miss rate for the
odds-on tree, as well as the number of nodes visited in both the cache and the
back up tree.

Since cache utilization can have a major impact on running time, the Valgrind
\cite{valgrind} cachegrind utility is used to simulate the cache performance
of the implementation, and data is collected on L1 and L2 cache miss rates.
